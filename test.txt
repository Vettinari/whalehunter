This is the problem:

Sergey AI modelPre-read: Predicting User Value Based on Early Behavioral Signals (DOI + 72h)
Context: We're building a model to predict user value (in USD) within 30 days, based on behavior in the first 72 hours post-DOI (double opt-in). Business need: optimize affiliate payouts and reduce overpayment on low-value traffic.
Challenge Overview:
* ~94% of users donâ€™t convert (zero revenue)
* Among converters (~6%), 50% make just 1 order
* Revenue distribution is fat-tailed (a few high-value users drive most revenue)
* Existing model predicts continuous values (e.g., $0.37), but packages are discrete ($39.99, $59.99)
Current Model Approach (v2):
* Tracks user behaviour for 48h post-DOI
* Includes hourly cumulative spend features
* Uses adjusted regression with smart post-processing:
    * Predicted values < $0.50 mapped to $0 (non-converters)
    * Remaining mapped to decile-based buckets aligned with actual outcomes
Business Insight:
* Model is pessimistic but directionally strong
* 85% of model-driven decisions to reduce payout would be correct

Next Step (v3): Extend to 72 Hours
* 99% of paying users convert within 5 days
* Including 72h should catch more late converters and reduce false negatives

Discussion Questions:
1. Should we switch from USD prediction to value bucket classification?Maybe anomaly analysis and then whale prediction?
2. Do we want to compress features further or explore hourly data clusteringcompress for what ? Is there a features analysis ?
3. Do we want to forecast conversion (yes/no) first, and then value?Anomaly + whale regression
4. Any constraints in downstream usage that affect how granular we can go?What? In terms of data shape?
Goal: Align on the best way to represent early user behavior for value prediction.
